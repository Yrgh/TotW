A game I am making in godot called Torch of the Wild. It is focused on surviving as a (normal?) human in a fictional wild filled with fictional creatures, plants, and more. At the center of it we have combatting large beasts before they kill you. Weapons take a realisticly long time to craft. I'm still thinking on whether to have magic.
